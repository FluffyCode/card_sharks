In Add a Card, a standard 52-card deck is used. The player is shown two random cards per round, and has a set amount of time to add them together. If correctly added, the player scores a point for that round. If incorrectly added, or if time expires, the player does not get a point for that round. Aces, Jacks, Queens, and Kings all have a value of 10 - all other cards are of standard rank value.
