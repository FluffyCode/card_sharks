# Game rules:
	# As per http://www.pagat.com/eights/crazy8s.html

	# Use standard 52-card deck.
	# 7 cards are dealt to both the player and dealer.
	# Remaining cards are placed face-down in a draw-pile.
	# The top card in the draw-pile is then played face-up.

	# Players take turns playing cards on top of the face-up (discard) pile.
	# If the face-up card is not an 8, only cards of the same rank or suit can be played on it.
		# Ie, if the card is a 4 of Spades, the only cards that can be played on top of it are
		# a 4 of any other suit, OR any rank as long as it is a Spade.

		# Exception: an 8 can be played on any suit/rank.  This is where "Crazy Eights" gets "crazy."

	# Eights can be played on any card.
	# When an 8 is played, the player placing the card declares a suit.
		# Only cards with the declared suit can be placed on top of the "crazy" eight.

		# Exception: players can place another 8 on top of an 8, and declare a new suit, themselves.

	# The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.
	# Losing player scores "penalty points" based on what cards they have left:
		# Any eight = 50 points.
		# Jack, Queen, King = 10 points.
		# All other cards at face value (Ace = 1, 2 = 2, etc...)

	# If a player cannot play a legal card, they must draw from the draw-pile.
	# If no cards remain in the draw-pile, play continues as normal without drawing.
