Crazy Eights - Game rules:
  As per http://www.pagat.com/eights/crazy8s.html

  Use standard 52-card deck.
  7 cards are dealt to both the player and dealer.
  Remaining cards are placed face-down in a draw-pile.
  The top card in the draw-pile is then played face-up.

  Players take turns playing cards on top of the face-up (discard) pile.
  If the face-up card is not an 8, only cards of the same rank or suit can be played on it.
    Ie, if the card is a 4 of Spades, the only cards that can be played on top of it are
    a 4 of any other suit, OR any rank as long as it is a Spade.

    Exception: an 8 can be played on any suit/rank.  This is where "Crazy Eights" gets "crazy."

  Eights can be played on any card.
  When an 8 is played, the player placing the card declares a suit.
    Only cards with the declared suit can be placed on top of the "crazy" eight.

    Exception: players can place another 8 on top of an 8, and declare a new suit, themselves.

  The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.
  Losing player scores "penalty points" based on what cards they have left:
    Any eight = 50 points.
    Jack, Queen, King = 10 points.
    All other cards at face value (Ace = 1, 2 = 2, etc...)

  If a player cannot play a legal card, they must draw from the draw-pile.
  If no cards remain in the draw-pile, play continues as normal without drawing.
